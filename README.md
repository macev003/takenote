## User Story

AS A user, I want to be able to write and save notes to be better organized. 

I WANT to be able to delete notes I've written before or notes that are no longer relevant. 

SO THAT I can organize my thoughts, keep track of the tasks I need to complete, and feel better about myself when I have completed a task.

## Business Context

For users that need to keep track of a lot of information, it's easy to forget or be unable to recall something important. Being able to take persistent notes allows users to have written information available when needed.
